BKN Editor Installation Guide
 
Download the BKN Editor application and required service scripts from,
 
https://github.com/bkn/bkn_editor/tarball/master
Required scripts include bkn_wsf.py, file_info.py and save_file.py. 
Versions of these file are included in the bkn_editor repository. 
The latest versions are at,
 
  https://github.com/bkn/bkn_wsf/tarball/master
  https://github.com/bkn/file_op/tarball/master
 
The files should be copied into a web accessible directory. 
bkn_editor also expects scripts to be in specific locations under the cgi-bin directory 
of the same server where bkn_editor is installed.
 
  cgi-bin/structwsf/bkn_wsf.py
  cgi-bin/file_op/save_file.py
  cgi-bin/file_op/file_info.py
 
A few subdirectories are required in the directory where bkn_editor is installed. 
bkn_editor uses a directory for storing data called 'user_files'. 
Each subdirectory under 'user_files' represents a data repository.
You can have as many repositories as you like.
Every file in a repository represents a dataset. 
Below, <repository_name> represents the name of a repository to store datasets (files).

mkdir user_files
mkdir user_files/selected_records
mkdir user_files/<repository_name>

These directories must be writable by the web server. 
You will need to set ownership and permissions. For instance,

chown -R _www:staff user_files
chmod -R a+rx user_files
chmod -R u+w user_files

The ls listings might look like,
 
  drwxr-xr-- 3 _www           staff        102 Nov 15 09:13 user_files
  drwxr-xr-- 3 _www           staff        102 Nov 15 09:13 user_files/selected_records
  
  
  
Additional Note:

The application uses a php file called download_file.php. 
The file is in the same directory as bkn_editor.
So the directory needs to be able to execute a php script.
If not an error is reported when clicking on 'Download Collection' for Selected Records.
