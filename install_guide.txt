BKN Editor Installation Guide
 
Download the BKN Editor application and required service scripts from,
 
https://github.com/bkn/bkn_editor/tarball/master
Required scripts include bkn_wsf.py and save_file.py. 
Versions of these file are included in the bkn_editor respository. 
The latest versions are at,
 
  https://github.com/bkn/bkn_wsf/tarball/master
  https://github.com/bkn/file_op/tarball/master
 
The files should be copied into a web accessible directory. 
bkn_editor also expects two scripts to be in specific locations under the cgi-bin directory 
of the same server where bkn_editor is installed.
 
  cgi-bin/structwsf/bkn_wsf.py
  cgi-bin/file_op/save_file.py
 
For the Selected Records functionality to work, the ‘user_files’ directory under bkn_editor 
must be owned by the web server. For example the ls listing might look like one of these,
 
  drwxr--r-- 3 _www           admin        102 Nov 15 09:13 user_files
  drwxr--r-- 2 www-data jalves  4096 2010-11-10 19:47 user_files
